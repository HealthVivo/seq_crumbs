Fix mac calculation. Take into account the ploidy.


Del paper del stacks:

paralogous stacks because all individuals homozygous for a specific sequence at one paralog and homozygous for a slightly different sequence in the other paralog would appear to be heterozygotes for the relevant SNP.
In addition, a diploid individual will never have more than two alleles of a single locus, so if individuals are discovered with three or more alleles, paralogs are likely to blame.
loci exhibited segregation distortion in segregation or HW in population. Especialmente exceso de heterocigotos.
