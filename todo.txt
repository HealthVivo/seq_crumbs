Statistics of the total coverage for SNP

Text for the statistic results

Filtros SNPs para evitar falsos snps debidos a par√°logos

- Coverage filter. A false snp due to a paralog sequence should have more total
coverage. We could draw the total coverage distribution and remove the ones
with to much coverage
- Not linked with the snps close to the studied snp in a small window (See Tassel
recomendations).
